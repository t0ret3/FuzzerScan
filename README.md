A brief description of what this project does and who it's for:


## Description
This program focuses on scanning shared resources in a specific network in order to perform fuzzing. In essence, fuzzing is a technique used to discover potential vulnerabilities in computer systems. It involves sending random or manipulated input data systematically to assess the robustness and security of systems. The primary goal is to identify possible weaknesses that could be exploited by potential attackers. This program is responsible for examining the available shared resources in the target network as part of this vulnerability discovery process.
